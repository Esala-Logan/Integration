# Project Title

This a program that asks the user what dish they want to make given a menu and based on their selection the program maps out the cooking process based on how much of the dish the user wants to make with ingredients listed and as they are added it basically "shows" them what is made, for example mixing together flour and egg thoroughly creates dough, I also want it to be like the user is taking the actions to create the dish like input mix to mix ingredients together<br />
This is my integration project for COP 1500<br />
I made this program alone (even though it definetly looks like it took a team of google engineers over 40 years to construct it.)<br />
I made this project at the first half of 2022 and I was (and am at the moment) a complete beginner<br />
I made this program for COP 1500 it is an assignment<br />
I mostly made this at my current home randomly when I was bored or when I would panic because an inspection was due<br />

## Documentation

## Diagrams

## Getting Started 
If you do not have it already download the latest version of python and open the file, you can then interact with it in the way I intended, for editing you're going to want to download an IDE like pycharm.<br />

## Built With

* Pycharm and pythons IDLE the project was originally started in pythons IDLE and I liked it but it was moved to pycharm and I now like pycharm more. 
* Python 3.10
* Resources used: Stackoverflow, Programiz, professor direction.<br />

## Contributing

Add items to the menu, fix my mistakes possibly, make it run more efficiently, or make it look more organized (because I was all over the place I think) specifically orgaizing the print statments and editing the way I chose to restart the program and deal with errors.
